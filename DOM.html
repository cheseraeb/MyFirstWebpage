                <p>
                        Once upon a time . . . there lived a giant who had quarrelled with a very 
                        greedy wizard over sharing a treasure. After the quarrel, the giant said 
                        menacingly to the wizard:
                           "I could crush you under my thumb if I wanted to! Now, get out of my 
                        sight!" The wizard hurried away, but from a safe distance, he hurled his 
                        terrible revenge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        "Abracadabra! Here I cast this spell! May the son, your wife will shortly 
                        give you, never grow any taller than my own thumb!"
                           After Tom Thumb was born, his parents were at their wits' end. They could 
                        never find him, for they could barely see him. They had to speak in whispers 
                        for fear of deafening the little boy. Tom Thumb preferred playing with the 
                        little garden creatures, to the company of parents so different from himself. 
                        He rode piggyback on the snail and danced with the ladybirds. Tiny as he was, 
                        he had great fun in the world of little things. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                        But one unlucky day, he went to visit a froggy friend. No sooner had he 
                        scrambled onto a leaf than a large pike swallowed him up. But the pike too was
                        fated to come to a very bad end. A little later, he took the bait cast by one 
                        of the King's fishermen, and before long, found himself under the cook's knife
                        in the royal kitchens. And great was everyone's surprise when, out of the 
                        fish's stomach, stepped Tom Thumb, quite alive and little the worse for his 
                        adventure.
