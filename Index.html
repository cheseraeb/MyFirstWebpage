                        <p>
                            Once upon a time . . . there lived a giant who had quarrelled with a very greedy wizard over sharing a treasure. After the
                            quarrel, the giant said menacingly to the wizard: "I could crush you under my thumb if I wanted to! Now,
                            get out of my sight!" The wizard hurried away, but from a safe distance, he hurled his terrible revenge.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            "Abracadabra! Here I cast this spell! May the son, your wife will shortly give you, never grow any taller than my own thumb!"
                            After Tom Thumb was born, his parents were at their wits' end. They could never find him, for they could
                            barely see him. They had to speak in whispers for fear of deafening the little boy. Tom Thumb preferred
                            playing with the little garden creatures, to the company of parents so different from himself. He rode
                            piggyback on the snail and danced with the ladybirds. Tiny as he was, he had great fun in the world of
                            little things.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            But one unlucky day, he went to visit a froggy friend. No sooner had he scrambled onto a leaf than a large pike swallowed
                            him up. But the pike too was fated to come to a very bad end. A little later, he took the bait cast by
                            one of the King's fishermen, and before long, found himself under the cook's knife in the royal kitchens.
                            And great was everyone's surprise when, out of the fish's stomach, stepped Tom Thumb, quite alive and
                            little the worse for his adventure.
